Javascript... for SCIENCE

- My grad school friends often ask me for help learning to code
- Best practices are a good idea - in fact great ideas! Or.. BEST IDEA!>!?!?!


Why help:
- Teaching will make you a better programmer and communicator of programming ideas
- Contributing to better scientific practices means more reliable results and better science
- You will learn a lot about science
- Progress in science is slowing down (prove it!)

Advice for Programmers:

Advice for Scientists:
- Yes, you may have been writing code that 'does enough of a job' but don't let that be the legacy you leave behind
- Accept that not writing tests is problematic - you probably don't write bug free code, none of us do, it's arrogant to think otherwise
- Working without version control is being irronspible with your time
- Be prepared to think differently about how you code



- Scientists are smart people but lack the domain knowledge that programmers in the industry have for writing maintainable code
- There is impetus to write throwaway software - once I'm out of grad school I no longer have to worry about or maintain it haha!
- Grad students will inherit legacy code to 'help them get started' - often they inherit a mess

- There are no tests!
- A scientist may spend time mathmatically proving something, then implement software to model and further prove their point, but then doesn't write tests for that software - big problem
- One overarching test is 'spits out the right answer' - insufficient, doesn't identify edge cases, doesn't test components of program individually to make sure they are reusable

- Insufficient version control 
- Having better version control implies more opportunity to iterate rather than waterfall

- The code is kept private - science should be an open process, so why isn't more science open source?
- Grossly hypocritical to not have code review
- Scientists might say that this gets in the way of the 'friendly competition'
- Scientists should publish their code to an open repository when the paper is published
