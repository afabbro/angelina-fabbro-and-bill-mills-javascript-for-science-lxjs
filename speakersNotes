1. Introductions (title slide)

2. Thesis Statement: Angelina 0:00 - 1:00
- My grad school friends often ask me for help learning to code
- Best practices are a good idea - in fact great ideas! Or.. BEST IDEA!>!?!?!

3. The State of Physics: Bill 1:00 - 5:00
-Moore's law for particle physics: experimental complexity on flagship CERN experiments has increaced by a factor of 10^4 in my lifetime
-CERN has excellent visualizations, but poor code reusability / portability / maintainability
-TRIUMF was a world leader in using web apps for experimental control, but no evolution has gone into web / interface / information design
-Conclusion: physics has has scaled past its software cultures.

4. Science Coding in the Wild: Angelina 5:00 - 15:00
- Scientists are smart people but lack the domain knowledge that programmers in the industry have for writing maintainable code
- There is impetus to write throwaway software - once I'm out of grad school I no longer have to worry about or maintain it haha!
- Grad students will inherit legacy code to 'help them get started' - often they inherit a mess

- There are no tests!
- A scientist may spend time mathmatically proving something, then implement software to model and further prove their point, but then doesn't write tests for that software - big problem
- One overarching test is 'spits out the right answer' - insufficient, doesn't identify edge cases, doesn't test components of program individually to make sure they are reusable

- Insufficient version control 
- Having better version control implies more opportunity to iterate rather than waterfall

- The code is kept private - science should be an open process, so why isn't more science open source?
- Grossly hypocritical to not have code review
- Scientists might say that this gets in the way of the 'friendly competition'
- Scientists should publish their code to an open repository when the paper is published

-Suggestions from Bill:
-include some research?  See papers on the value of tests for example, but the more the merrier:
http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/TDDpaperv8.pdf
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ese/nagappan_tdd.pdf
-content examples:
	-cut and paste code: concequence of no code review, costing students opportunities
	-monolith code: loose grasp of architecture
	-waterfall testing: physics validation only tests what falls out the very bottom
	-frostypipe: tragic interface, would be faster and more elegant in a web interface

5. Problems in Science UI: Bill 15:00 - 25:00
-Angelina just illustrated some of the gaps in the nuts and bolts of the science code she's seen in the wild; now let's look at my efforts to address science's other main deficit: user interaction
-Introduce GRIFFIN's experimental program briefly
	-R process
	-symmetries
	-nuclear structure
-Introduce GRIFFIN's new attitude towards development and UI
	-open source
	-code reviews
	-web based UI, motivated by the need to accomodate many rotating groups of users
-Problem 1: Skeumorphic Representation
	-Show DESCANT's detector view, explain briefly what we're looking at
	-contrast to a table dump of the same numbers
	-Skeumorphic design provides crucial geometric and contextual information that text views can't capture
	-We need to find a way to include not just the explicit information, but all its 'contextual metadata'.
-Problem 1-a: Skeumorphic Engineering
	-There isn't a physics-satisfactory solution for skeumorphic web design; canvas is too dumb, SVG too heavy, frameworks have too much bulk
	-In addition to its technical benefits, the ability to cherry-pick bits of a framework would make them much more paletable for physicists.
-Problem 1-b: Skeumorphic Design
	-Skeumorphism is really useful, but it can go wrong fast: contrast DESCANT (70 channels) to SHARC (>900); need good designers to do it right
-Problem 2: Interaction Design
	-Another serious problem with text-based UI is that is has no concept of gesture and little accomodation of the 'interaction vernacular' that we have all become fluent in
	-Explain the concept of a trigger, show 8Pi's trigger configuration rosetta
	-GRIFFIN tries to solve the problem with a natural 'building blocks' drag and drop interface
	-Analysis is a field that could dramatically benefit from more contextual and interactive UI

6. Computing Culture From the Ground Up: Angelina 25:00 - 35:00
Why help:
- Teaching will make you a better programmer and communicator of programming ideas
- Contributing to better scientific practices means more reliable results and better science
- You will learn a lot about science
- Progress in science is slowing down (prove it!)

Advice for Programmers:

Advice for Scientists:
- Yes, you may have been writing code that 'does enough of a job' but don't let that be the legacy you leave behind
- Accept that not writing tests is problematic - you probably don't write bug free code, none of us do, it's arrogant to think otherwise
- Working without version control is being irronspible with your time
- Be prepared to think differently about how you code

-Suggestions from Bill:
-Developers often start with top-down enforcement to expose them to good programing as they learn, but the sciences will need grassroots enculturation
-'Treating code as a 1st class research citizen' needs a strong cultural base
	-The problem in the sciences isn't so much a fundamental problem with skills, but one of culture
	-Scientists treat their code as a means to a single end
	-Scientists often view the process of coding as an inconvenient chore
	-Academia continues to fail to incorporate computing education for undergrads, or code review for graduate students
	(more to come)

7.  Closing Remarks - Bill 35:00 - 38:00
-Plenty of other fields beyond physics need your help too
	-Agriculture
	-Life sciences
-Most interesting comment was from an ecologist - please just sit down with us and start a conversation!
-Conclusion: the sun is setting on reductionism!  If we work together, we can do great things.
